        "description": "When we heard actor Elizabeth Olsen likes In-N-Out but considers herself a burger novice, we knew we had to step in and change that. That's why host Alvin Cailan and his comedic side-kick Christian Alquiza have made it their personal mission to create the ultimate burger master class for the star of HBO Max's new series, Love & Death. Behold: A tasting menu of three custom burgers, featuring 1). An In-N-Out Oklahoma fried-onion hybrid, 2). A riff on the iconic patty melt, and 3). A surprise burger inspired by Elizabeth's all-time favorite pasta dish! We fact checked our sources. We did our research.

          "description": "When we heard actor Elizabeth Olsen likes In-N-Out but considers herself a burger novice, we knew we had to step in and change that. That's why host Alvin Cailan and his comedic side-kick Christian Alquiza have made it their personal mission to create the ultimate burger master class for the star of HBO Max's new series, Love & Death. Behold: A tasting menu of three custom burgers, featuring 1). An In-N-Out Oklahoma fried-onion hybrid, 2). A riff on the iconic patty melt, and 3). A surprise burger inspired by Elizabeth's all-time favorite pasta dish! We fact checked our sources. We did our research.

Dive into uncharted waters with Jason Statham and global action icon Wu Jing as they lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean. Their voyage spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival. Pitted against colossal Megs and relentless environmental plunderers, our heroes must outrun, outsmart, and outswim their merciless predators in a pulse-pounding race against time. Immerse yourself in the most electrifying cinematic experience of the year with “Meg 2: The Trench” – where the depths of the ocean are matched only by the heights of sheer, unstoppable excitement!\n\nWarner Bros.
